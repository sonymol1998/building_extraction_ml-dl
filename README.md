# building_extraction_ml-dl
Overview:
This repository provides an implementation of building extraction from satellite imagery using deep learning techniques, specifically utilizing the ResNet model architecture. Building extraction is a crucial task in various applications such as urban planning, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. Deep learning models offer a promising approach to automate this process with high accuracy.

Key Features:

ResNet Model: The repository includes a ResNet model implementation tailored for building extraction tasks. ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in handling very deep networks. It overcomes the degradation problem by introducing skip connections, allowing the model to learn residual mappings instead of attempting to learn the desired underlying mapping directly.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing plays a significant role in the effectiveness of deep learning models. This repository includes scripts for data preprocessing tasks such as image normalization, augmentation, and labeling.

Training Pipeline: The repository provides a comprehensive training pipeline for training the ResNet model on satellite imagery datasets. This pipeline includes data loading, model training, evaluation, and saving checkpoints for further use.

Inference Module: Once the model is trained, an inference module is included to perform building extraction on new satellite images. This module takes input satellite images and outputs binary masks indicating the presence or absence of buildings.

Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of the model, various evaluation metrics are implemented, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Intersection over Union (IoU).

Usage:

Installation: Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements file.

Data Preparation: Prepare your satellite imagery dataset and corresponding ground truth labels if available. Ensure the dataset is organized according to the specified directory structure.

Training: Run the training script, specifying the dataset directory and training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the provided evaluation scripts, which compute various metrics to assess the model's performance.

Inference: Utilize the trained model for building extraction on new satellite images by running the inference module.
